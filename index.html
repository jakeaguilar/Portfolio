                    Passion for Tech
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My passion for coding did not arise until early in my adult life. When I was
                    a kid, I thought I would have a career as a something to do with animals, as i thought animals
                    were fascinating. I already knew I did not want to become a vetrinarian,
                    so that limited my options and made me realize I really did not know what I wanted to do with animals, only that I liked them.
                    So i decided to dive in to my second passion at the time, technology and more specifically, coding.
