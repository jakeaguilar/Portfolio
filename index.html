                    <p>
                        My passion for coding did not arise until early in my adult life. When I was
                        a kid, I thought I would have a career as a something to do with animals, as i thought animals
                        were fascinating. I already knew I did not want to become a vetrinarian,
                        so that limited my options and made me realize I really did not know what I wanted to do with animals, only that I liked them.
                        So i decided to dive in to my second passion at the time, technology and more specifically, coding.
